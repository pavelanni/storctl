# Logging Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-12-12

## Context

- Need for consistent logging across the application
- Requirement for different log levels (debug, info, error)
- Need for structured logging to facilitate log analysis
- Requirement for flexible log output formats (text, JSON)
- Need to support both development and production environments

## Decision

Use Go's built-in `log/slog` package as the primary logging framework with the following principles:

1. Structured Logging
   - Use structured fields instead of string interpolation
   - Include consistent field names across log entries

2. Log Levels
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
   - INFO: General operational events
   - WARN: Warning events that might need attention
   - ERROR: Error events that need immediate attention

3. Standard Context Fields
   - timestamp
   - level
   - component
   - operation
   - error (when applicable)

4. Configuration
   - Allow log level configuration via config file and environment variables
   - Support both text and JSON output formats
   - Enable log level adjustment at runtime

## Consequences

### Positive

- Built-in to Go 1.21+, no external dependencies
- Structured logging makes log parsing and analysis easier
- Consistent logging format across the application
- Easy to integrate with log aggregation tools
- Good performance characteristics
- Type-safe field values

### Negative

- Requires Go 1.21 or later
- More verbose than simple printf-style logging
- Need to maintain consistent field names
- May require additional configuration for advanced features
